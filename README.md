# EDE — Everyday Developer Essentials

_A free, resilient, human‑friendly toolkit for developers_

EDE is a collection of small, focused, beautifully crafted tools designed to make everyday development tasks effortless.  
Each tool is fast, accessible, and intentionally minimal — no ads, no tracking, no friction.

EDE is built on a simple belief:

> **Essential tools should be free, reliable, and available to everyone.**

Whether you're generating UUIDs, converting files, creating slugs, or exploring time zones, EDE gives you a consistent, predictable experience across all tools.

## ✨ Core Principles

### **1. Clarity over complexity**

Every tool is designed to be obvious at a glance.  
No hidden states. No surprises.

### **2. Resilience by design**

Tools work offline where possible.  
Fallback logic is explicit and intentional.

### **3. Free and accessible forever**

EDE rejects gatekeeping.  
These tools belong to the community.

### **4. Consistency across tools**

Every tool follows the same structure, UI rhythm, and interaction patterns.

### **5. Human‑friendly documentation**

Clear language. No jargon. No guesswork.
